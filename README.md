# PenTesting-Live-Targets-Challenge

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only a few of each of the possible exploits.

----------------------------------------------------

## Green

Vulnerability #1: _________Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)_________

Description: I discovered on the green website that the "Contact Us" page was vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. On the "Feedback" text bar under "Your name" and "Your email", an attacker can input a malicious script that will activate on the admin or staff side of the website. As shown through the GIF, I was able to insert an alert that appeared on the feedback page under the staff page.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: _______Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)___________

Description: For this vulnerability, I discovered on the red website that when you visit the "Find a salesperson" webpage and select a Salesperson with their name bolded in a hyper link, the link contains an ID number for the page. Example: https ://35.184.88.145/red/public/salesperson.php?id=4 . Upon changing the ID number to something that exceeds what the webpage shows, I was able to see other salespersons that weren't originally listed along with the reason why they were let go. Something the other websites did to prevent this from happening was that when an IDOR attack was attempted, it would instead redirect the user back to the main "Find a salesperson" page instead of leaking unlisted information.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: ________Session Hijacking/Fixation__________

Description: With the information provided based off of this vulnerability, I was able to determine that the blue website was vulnerable to this exploit because as mentioned, the website's session renewal intervals last about one year, and never regenerates the session ID. I was able to exploit this vulnerablility using the provided script, Burpsuite, and having two seperate browsers: one being the attacker, and the other being the admin/user logging in. The provided script allowed me to see the session ID of the unauthenticated user, and Burpsuite allowed me to capture the packet containing the session ID of the authenticated admin/user. Which the script then allowed me to alter the session ID of the unauthenticated user to the authenticated admin, and give me access to the staff page.
